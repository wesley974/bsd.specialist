== 4.4 BSD

*BSD* (Berkeley Software Distribution), sometimes called Berkeley Unix, 
it is the Unix operating system developed and distributed by the Computer 
Systems Research Group (*CSRG*) of the University of California, Berkeley, from 1977 to 1995. 

Historically, BSD has been considered as a branch of UNIX â€” "BSD UNIX", 
because it shared the initial codebase and design with the original AT&T UNIX operating system.

The final release from Berkeley was 1995's 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2, 
after which the CSRG was dissolved and development of BSD at Berkeley ceased. 
Since then, several variants based directly or indirectly on 4.4BSD-Lite 
(such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD) have been maintained.
