== Control process execution

*jobs*, *bg*, *fg*, *stop*, and *notify* are shell built-in commands.

TIP: If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may press <Ctrl-z> which sends a STOP signal to the current job.

TIP: You can run a command line in background just adding a `&` at the end of the line, example: `sleep 10 && echo Hello World &`

`jobs` displays the status of the jobs that were started in the current shell environment

`fg _[%job]_` brings the current or specified jobs into the foreground, continuing them if they were stopped.

`bg _[%job]_` puts the current or specified jobs into the background, continuing them if they were stopped.

`stop _%job_` stops the current or specified jobs that are executing in the background.

`notify _[%job]_` causes the shell to notify the user asynchronously when the status of the current or specified jobs change.

WARNING: `notify` is not available on ksh, and sh.
