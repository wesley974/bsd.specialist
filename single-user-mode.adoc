== Booting to Single-User Mode

Once init takes control of the booting process, it can place the system in single-user mode instead of completing all the 
initialization tasks required for multiuser mode. Single-user mode is a system state designed for administrative and 
maintenance activities, which require complete and unshared control of the system. This system state is selected by a 
special boot command parameter or option; on some systems, the administrator may select it by pressing a designated key 
at a specific point in the boot process.

To initiate single-user mode, init forks to create a new process, which then executes the default 
shell (usually /bin/sh) as user root. The prompt in single-user mode is the number sign (#), 
the same as for the superuser account, reflecting the root privileges inherent in it. Single-user mode is occasionally 
called maintenance mode .

Another situation in which the system might enter single-user mode automatically occurs if there are any problems 
in the boot process that the system cannot handle on its own. Examples of such circumstances include filesystem problems 
that fsck cannot fix in its default mode and errors in one of the system initialization files. The system administrator 
must then take whatever steps are necessary to resolve the problem. Once this is done, booting may continue to multiuser 
mode by entering CTRL-D, terminating the single-user mode shell.

Single-user mode represents a minimal system startup. Although you have root access to the system, many of the normal system 
services are not available at all or are not set up. On a mundane level, the search path and terminal type are often not 
set correctly. Less trivially, no daemons are running, so many Unix facilities are shut down (e.g., printing). In general, 
the system is not connected to the network. The available filesystems may be mounted read-only, so modifying files is initially 
disabled (weâ€™ll see how to overcome this in a bit). Finally, since only some of the filesystems are mounted, only commands 
that physically reside on these filesystems are available initially.

This limitation is especially noticeable if /usr was created on a separate disk partition from the root filesystem and is 
not mounted automatically under single-user mode. In this case, even commands stored in the root filesystem (in /bin, for example) 
will not work if they use shared libraries stored under /usr. Thus, if there is some problem with the /usr filesystem, you will 
have to make do with the tools that are available. For such situations, however rare and unlikely, 
you should know how to use the ed editor if vi is not available in single-user mode; you should know which tools are 
available to you in that situation before you have to use them.

On a few systems, vendors have exacerbated this problem by making /bin a symbolic link to /usr/bin, thereby rendering the 
system virtually unusable if there is a problem with a separate /usr filesystem.

Now, how to boot manually in single user mode ?
2 ways :

- On startup, at the boot prompt:

....
boot> boot -s
....

- Or using the file /etc/boot.conf:

....
# echo "boot -s" >> /etc/boot.conf
....
